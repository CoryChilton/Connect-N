# Connect N Bot

A Connect N game I coded in C++ using object-oriented programming. It is like Connect 4 but you can play with any size board and choose how many in a row it takes to win. Play player vs. player, against a bot that plays poorly, against a bot that always plays perfectly, or even have bots play against each other!

The most difficult part of this project was coding the bot that always plays perfectly. It uses the minimax algorithm which is a recursive backtracking algorithm that is used in game theory to find the optimal move. It considers all of the possible moves that it can play and how a player playing optimally would respond to those moves.
